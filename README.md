# SQL_learning
This repository is a collection of the code that I wrote while taking the SQL for Data Analysis course on Udacity. The course is designed to teach the fundamentals of SQL, including how to query and manipulate data in a variety of database management systems.

The code in this repository represents the various exercises and projects that I completed throughout the course. It includes SQL queries for data analysis, as well as scripts for data manipulation and cleaning.
